#+TITLE: Xdg

=xdg-mime= and =xdg-open= are used to manage default programs for Linux. On Arch,
they can be installed using the =xdg-utils= package.

Usually, all files have a *mimetype* associated with them. To find out this mimetype,
run the following command:
#+begin_src shell
xdg-mime query filetype <filename>
#+end_src
For example, if you run this on a =png= file, then the output would be =image/png=.

Now, to find out the default program that will be launched for this particular
mimetype, run
#+begin_src shell
xdg-mime query default <mimetype>
#+end_src

To change the default program for a mimetype, run
#+begin_src shell
xdg-mime default <program>.desktop <mimetype>
#+end_src
For example, if you want to change the default program for opening =png= files
with =imv=, run
#+begin_src shell
xdg-mime default imv.desktop image/png
#+end_src
