*** Remarks
- For real user activity, each user has 4 metrics:
  1. articles bookmarked
  2. articles read
  3. companies explored
  4. companies bookmarked
- The real user activity metric should be represented by a time-series graph of the moving average, and also display the % of users below average.
- The app store reviews should be a word cloud of all the non 5-star reviews.

*** Doubts & Clarifications
- [X] What is =entity_id= in the =useractivity= data?
- [ ] Jupyter dashboard is *STILL* giving BT.
- [X] What kind of timestamps are provided in the =useractivity= data?

- collect data and show analysis
*** DONE Points
- [X] Inconsistent data:
  - [X] IGMNo., TimeofArrival missing in the second data.
  - [X] Origin in the first data, destination in the second data (import export)
- [X] Find out which pieces of data I can discard.
- [X] Setup sqlite (maybe)
* Manifest data
<2022-08-16 Tue>

- Weight, bags, country, flight, courier, and if consignee or consignor are same for many consignments ,goods being imported or exported description and Hsn
- Also seeing their behaviour over a period of time: Sudden jump some day
- After seeing overall analysis , seeing the individual details will be necessary
- Country wise analysis is always helpful
- And if there is any scheme benefit column look into that too
- Many a time while exporting people take some benefit drawback, MEIS, Rodtep, RoSTCL or do it under LUT
- LUT means letter of undertaking and in this case they take refund from GST not us. So from evasion pt of view is necessary to be checked

** Remarks
- bags, Flight details not in manifest
