* Downgrading packages
How to downgrade packages when your Arch installation breaks.

To list all the cached package archives of all the packages historically installed
on your system:
#+begin_src shell
ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/
#+end_src

To downgrade to some cached version of the package, run the following command with
root priveleges:
#+begin_src shell
pacman -U /path/to/package/archive
#+end_src

* How to make the downgrade persistent
To prevent the package from being updated on the next system update, edit the
=/etc/pacman.conf= file, and add the package name in the =IgnorePkg= option.
