Use the =beamer= package:

Then, inside the document body, wrap the content you want to put in a slide with
the =frame= environment:
#+begin_src latex
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{This is the frame title}
\framesubtitle{This is the frame subtitle}
Hello there
\end{frame}
#+end_src

Beamer has a few different [[https://latex-beamer.com/tutorials/beamer-themes/][themes]] available by default, which can be used by:
