#+TITLE: Changing the Appearance of Your Document

We're going to use a package called =titlesec=, which will enable us the modify how
our document headings look.
#+begin_src latex
\usepackage{titlesec}
#+end_src

Suppose we want to change how the default =\section= looks:
#+begin_src latex
\titleformat{\section}
{\huge\lowercase\bfseries} % Font style
{\thesection} % Numbering
{0em} % Distance between the numbering and the section title
{} % Display anything after the gap, but before the title
#+end_src

This type of modification can be made to any other title command.

One interesting optional argument for the =\titleformat= command is the =runin=
argument:
#+begin_src latex
\titleformat{\subsection}[runin]
{\huge\lowercase\bfseries}
{\thesection}
{0em}
{\titlerule} % This will add a horizontal line below the subsection
#+end_src
This argument will make the content appear on the same line as the heading.
