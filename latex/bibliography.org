#+TITLE: Bibliography management in LaTeX

* Importing the packages
Make sure the =biber= package is installed.
We're going to use the =biblatex= package for managing bibliographies:
#+begin_src latex
\usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
#+end_src

* Importing the bibliography file
To import the bibliography (=.bib= file):
#+begin_src latex
\addbibresource{file.bib}
#+end_src

* Adding citations
Let's say we have an entry in our =.bib= file with the name =foo=.
** in-text citations
#+begin_src latex
As \textcite{foo} rightfully said, LaTeX rocks!
#+end_src
** parenthetical citations
#+begin_src latex
According to a study \parencite{foo}, LaTeX rocks!
#+end_src

* Compiling the bibliography file
After adding the citation command into out latex file, we actually need to
use =biber= to compile the bibliographies:
#+begin_src shell
biber latex_filename_without_extension
#+end_src

* Adding reference section
Wherever we want to place our references:
#+begin_src latex
\printbibliography
#+end_src
