#+title:Direct Memory Access

- In the [[id:2c8335ac-5776-4dba-9cbd-0873a7555f13][8086 Microprocessor]], Direct Memory Access is a concept in which the memory can be accessed (read or written to) by the IO.
- The $\textrm{HOLD}$ and $\overline{\textrm{HLDA}}$ pins are used for this feature.
- Whenever the $\textrm{HOLD}$ pin is given logical one, in the next T-state, $\textrm{HLDA}$ becomes a logical one and the microprocessor stops execution. All buses go into high impedance state.
