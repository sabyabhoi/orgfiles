#+title: Bad Personal Values

* Traits of bad personal values
- In contrast to the [[id:b028d447-a3f8-4a6f-855f-6d9a6482d9fb][Good Personal Values]], these are the [[id:b83aba99-4575-407e-a48b-48a538d73b1d][personal values]] which are
** Superstitious
- These values are not static across different people.
- E.g. if you think you're popular, someone else might think you're not.
** Socially destructive
- Doesn't improve you or/and the society
** Not Immediate or controllable
- You cannot control this value immediately.
- E.g. making a girl you admire like you back.
* Examples
- Some examples include
  - dominance through manipulation/violence
  - philandering
  - feeling good all the time
  - always being the centre of attention
  - not being alone
  - being rich just for the sake of it

* Notably poor personal values
** Pleasure
- Pleasure is not the cause of happiness, rather it is the /effect/.
** Material success
** Always being right
- We're wrong most of the time; hence, it's pointless to aim to be right all the time.
- Establishing that we're right all the time eliminates all scope of further progress in life.
** Staying Positive
- [[id:c523a4ca-3482-47e6-9dd5-ddff83a7fe03][Suffering]] is an inescapable part of life; avoiding it is futile.
- Trying to stay positive all the time and not addressing the problems only provides us with *temporary highs*; once the high gets over, the problem still persists (and even grows in some cases).
