#+title: Regularization
#+filetags: :CS:

Regularization is a technique in machine learning used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of a model.

* Ridge Regularization
Here, we add a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights to the [[id:017b7c98-adcc-43ea-9af0-640f99ec9d08][Cost function]].

\[
	\textrm{Cost} = \textrm{normal cost} + \frac{\lambda}{2 m} \sum w_j^2
\]

Here $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter which denotes the amount of penalty to add. Greater the value of $\lambda$, more is the penalty, and smaller will be the weights.
