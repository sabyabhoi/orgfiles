#+title: Suffering
#+filetags: :Life-Advice:

- Happiness isn't /"achievable"/.
- Dissatisfaction and unease are inherent part of human life.
- Suffering is biologically useful:
  - It is due to suffering that people evolve and innovate new ideas.

* Chosing suffering
- Instead of thinking about how to avoid suffering (which is impossible), one should think about chosing their suffering.
- /"What am I willing to struggle for?"/
