\[
D/E = \frac{\textrm{Total liabilities}}{\textrm{Shareholder's equity}}
\]

- This ratio is useful for understanding a company's risk status.
- Lower is better.
- E.g. if a company has a =D/E= of 2, that means that it has Rs. 2 worth of debt for every Rs. 1 of equity. This means that the company is high risk.
