* Countable sets
A set is said to be countable if it has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers. In other words, we can create a [[id:0910229d-b3b2-4b15-93f1-1e128f518a3c][bijection]] from the set of positive integers to this set in order to rank all the elements of the set. 
E.g. Set of all odd numbers; set of all rational numbers.

** Properties
- It can be proved that the union and intersection of two countable sets is countable.

* Uncountable sets
When we cannot create a [[id:0910229d-b3b2-4b15-93f1-1e128f518a3c][bijection]] between the given set and the set of positive integers, the set is said to be uncountably infinite.
E.g. Set of real numbers; set of irrational numbers.
