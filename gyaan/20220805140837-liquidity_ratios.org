\[
\textrm{Quick ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Current Assets} - \textrm{Inventory}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}}
\]

- Can be considered a modification to [[id:352e757e-5353-4063-ba90-e510739c57db][Current ratio]].
- Higher is better.
- Inventories aren't (in true sense) current assets.

** Further modifications
Inventory can further be divided into three types:
1. Fast moving (/fastest to sell/)
2. Slow moving (/slow to sell/)
3. Dead (/doesn't sell at all/)

Then the quick ratio can be modified to exclude just the *slow* and *dead* inventories:

\[
\textrm{Quick ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Current Assets} - \textrm{slow}- \textrm{dead}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}}
\]

* Cash ratio
* Operating Cash Flow (OCF)

\[
OCF = \textrm{Revenues} - \textrm{Operating expenses}
\]

- It is simply the money generated by a company from its business activities.
- Higher is better.
- This ratio can be found in a company's *Annual and Quarterly Cash Flow statements*.
- Measures a company's abililty to pay its bills.

*Note*: The sources of revenue should be observed carefully: whether the revenue is coming from sales operations or liquidating assets.
