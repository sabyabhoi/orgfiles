#+title:Auditor's Report
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

- Look for an *Independent(unbiased)* auditor's report before investing in a company.
- Shareholders aren't allowed to look at the actual books of accounts (sales revenue etc.) by showing up at the company.
- So auditors are appointed by the shareholders who go into the company and check all the books of accounts. 

* Main Point
- Go to the opinion section and check whether the financial statements give a *true and fair view* of the company.
- *Bad sign*: Auditor resigns because they may be getting pressurized by the promoters in some way. 
* Key Audit Matters
- Discloses important findings of the auditor communicated with the promoters.
