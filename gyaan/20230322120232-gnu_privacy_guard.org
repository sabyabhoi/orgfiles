* Generating a key-pair
#+begin_src shell
gpg --full-gen-key
#+end_src

* Encrypting a file
Suppose we have a simple text file:
#+begin_src shell
echo "Hello there" > file.txt
#+end_src

Then to encrypt this file:
#+begin_src shell
gpg -e -r recipient@email.com file.txt
#+end_src
Here, the enter the email of the recipient. If you don't want anyone other than
you to read the contents of the file, just put in the email you entered during
the key-pair generation

This will generate a new encrypted file called =file.txt.gpg=.

** A healthy practice
After the file is encrypted, the original file should be shreded to remove all
trace:
#+begin_src shell
shred -u file.txt
#+end_src
* Decrypting a file
Just enter the command:
#+begin_src shell
gpg -d file.txt.gpg
#+end_src
