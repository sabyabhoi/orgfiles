This is used to calculate the rate of returns on equity for a firm

\[
R_S = R_F + \beta (R_M - R_F)
\]

here,
- R_S is the return on equity
- R_F is the risk-free rate of return (usually returns on T-bills/bonds)
- R_M is the industry rate of return.
- \beta is the sensitivity:

\[
\beta = \frac{\textrm{Cov}(R_I, R_M)}{\textrm{Var}(R_M)}
\]

* Security Market Line
The plot between R_s and \beta is called the *Security Market Line*.
