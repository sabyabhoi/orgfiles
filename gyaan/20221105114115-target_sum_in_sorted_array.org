#+title: Target sum in sorted array
#+filetags: :CS:CONCEPT:

Given a sorted [[id:5adf9d6d-4832-420c-8c61-41d7747a47d1][array]] =a[n]=, we're supposed to find a pair =(x, y)= such that =a[x] + a[y] = target=.

* Approach
We take [[id:d7ee77e6-ac4d-472b-9e6c-8660076a2b15][two pointers]] =l= and =r= such that =l= points to the start of the array and =r= points to the end of the array.
If their sum is greater than the target, decrease =r=.
If their sum is less than the target, increase =l=.
If their sum is equal to the target, return =(l, r)=.

      n = len(a)
      l = 0
      r = n - 1

      while l <= r:
          if a[l] + a[r] == target:
              return (l + 1, r + 1)
          elif a[l] + a[r] > target:
              r -= 1
          else:
              l += 1
      return (-1, -1)
