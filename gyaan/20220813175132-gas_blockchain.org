#+title: Gas (Blockchain)
#+filetags: :CS:

- Gas is a unit of computational measure. It is used for measuring the amount an entity is supposed to pay for any given transaction in a ledger on a [[id:94a4aacb-7799-4d2a-8185-f94150fa7ea2][blockchain]]. 
- The more computation a transaction uses, the more /gas/ one has to pay.
- It is basically the fee paid to a node operator for successfully adding a
  transaction to the [[id:94a4aacb-7799-4d2a-8185-f94150fa7ea2][blockchain]].
* Gas limit
This limit basically specifies how much gas we're willing to spend on a transaction.
If the computation exceeds this gas, the transaction won't take place.

Therefore,
$\textrm{Transaction fee} = \textrm{Gas used} \times \textrm{Gas Price}$
