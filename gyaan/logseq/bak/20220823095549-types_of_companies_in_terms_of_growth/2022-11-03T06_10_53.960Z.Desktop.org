#+title: Types of companies (in terms of growth)
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

* Slow growers
- These companies grow at nearly the same rate as the GNP of the a country.
- They usually start off as fast growers, but then they saturate and slow down.
- One telltale sign of a slow grower is that it gives generous/regular *dividends*.
* Stalwarts
- Stalwart means reliable/stable.
- These companies grow faster than the slow growers.
- They have usually 10-12% p.a. growth rates, so don't expect a net profit of more than 30-50%.
- These are credible during recession.
*  Fast growers
- These are fast, aggressive firms growing at 20-25% p.a.
- A fast growing company doesn't necessarily belong to a fast growing industry.
- Look for a good balance sheet and substantial profits to identify a fast grower.
- It is quite important to figure out /when/ a fast grower stops growing.
* Cyclicals
- These companies fluctuate with the economy.
- Examples include:
  - automotives
  - airlines
  - tire industry
  - steel
  - chemicals
* Turnaround
- Initially, they're no growers, but they compensate for their flaws rather swiftly.
* Asset Play
- These are the companies sitting on some undervalued assets.
- General, asset play exists when the net value of assets per share is substantially greater than the share price:

\[
\frac{\textrm{net value of assets}}{\textrm{no. of shares}} >> \textrm{share price}
\]
