#+title: Problems with Assymetric Information
#+filetags: :ECONOMICS:

Assymetric information exists when two parties getting into any kind of transaction have different amount of information available at their disposal.

To elucidate the problems related with assymetric information, we're going to employ an example of a health insurance agency.

* Adverse Selection
Adverse in this context means /bad/. It is possible for a rather unhealty person to lie about their health status in order to get a lower premium on their health insurance.

** Solution
Screening (background check) is a solution for eliminating the problem of adverse selection.

* Moral Hazard
This relates to the problem of increased risk appetite amongst people who are now insured. E.g. people may eat more unhealthy food now that they're insured.

** Solution
Monitoring or sign a contract with restrictive covenant
