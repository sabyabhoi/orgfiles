* E Chord Shape
[[../assets/E-Chord Shape.png]]

If we only consider the first four strings, we get the chord in its *root form* (/no inversions/).
* C Chord Shape
[[../assets/C-Chord Shape.png]]

This chord shape itself isn't very famous, but if we consider the first four strings, we get the chord in its *first inversion*.
* A Chord Shape
[[../assets/A-Chord Shape.png]]

If consider the first four strings here, we get the chord in its *second inversion*.
