#+title: Relational Database Management System
#+filetags: :CS:

It is a type of software that is used to manage relational databases. A relational database is a collection of tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The rows in a table represent individual records, and the columns represent specific attributes of the records.

An RDBMS provides tools and interfaces for creating, modifying, and querying relational databases. It stores data in a structured way, so that it can be easily searched, sorted, and retrieved. An RDBMS also enforces rules and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

One of the key features of an RDBMS is its support for SQL (Structured Query Language), which is a standard language for managing relational databases. SQL allows users to create and modify tables, insert, update and delete records, and query data from the database. RDBMSs are used in a wide variety of applications, from small-scale personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems, and are essential tools for managing and analyzing data in many industries.
