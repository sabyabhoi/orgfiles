#+title:Associates
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

- When a company has an associate, it means they have a certain level of influence and involvement in another company's operations, usually by owning a significant portion of their shares (usually between 20% and 50%).
- The company accounts for its investment in the associate using the equity method, which means they record their share of the associate's profits or losses in their own financial statements.
