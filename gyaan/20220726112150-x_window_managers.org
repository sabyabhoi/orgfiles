#+title: X Window Managers
#+filetags: :CS:

- X.org uses a server-client model.
- Therefore, an X client is required to connect to the X.org server.
- A window manager is a simple X client.
  - It doesn't have an root priveleges.
  - It communicates with X server using API calls.

* Window Hierarchy
- In X.org, *a window is any rectangular area that is an unit of user interaction/graphic display*.
- These windows are organized in a tree hierarchy, where the root of the tree is the *root window*: a virtual, invisible window that has the same size as the screen, and is always present.
* Substructure Redirection

:END:
- In the absence of window managers, a program directly sends requests to the X server if it wishes to communicate with the server (for resizing,moving windows etc.).
- But when a window manager is present, it intercepts these requests and sends them to the X server.
- This is called *Substructure Redirection*.  
* Reparenting/Framing

- An X window manager adds buttons for minimizing/maximizing and closing windows. This is called *Reparenting* or *framing*.
- In order to do this,
  1. the window manager creates a child of the root which is larger than the top level window of the application.
  2. Calls the =XReparentWindow()= function, specifying the top level window of the application as _win_, and the new window it created as _parent_.

** Non-reparenting window managers
- If a window manager doesn't decorate the top level windows, then it doesn't need to reparent them. E.g. xmonad, dwm.
* Compositing

:END:
- A *Composite Extension* is provided to request the X server to not render a specific window and its children directly to the screen, but rather maintain a special buffer without redundant computations.
- This buffer can be used by the client that made the request.
- This is what /compositors/ and /compositing window managers/ do: they ask X server to render the top level windows to an in-memory buffer and *composite* the results into an overlay window itself.
