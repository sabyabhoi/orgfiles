#+title: IPFS
#+filetags: :CS:

- Stands for *Inter Planetry File System*.
- It is a decentralized file sharing system.
- It used *content based sharing* rather than *location based sharing (IP address based)*.
- Each file has a unique hash by which it is addressed.
- When multiple people upload the same file, it is only created once.

* Storing files on IPFS
- Stored in *IPFS Objects*.
** IPFS Objects
- can store upto 256 KB of data
- can contain links to other IPFS objects
- are immutable by default
* Modifying data on IPFS
- IPFS offers versioning.
- Whenever we create or update an IPFS block, a new commit block is created with information about the current and the previous version of the object.
* Limitation
- If all the nodes containing a particular piece data go offline, then the data becomes inaccessible.
** Solution
- Incentivize people to host nodes using [[id:94a4aacb-7799-4d2a-8185-f94150fa7ea2][cryptocurrencies]]: [[https://filecoin.io/][Filecoin]].
- Proactively distribute files multiple times to make sure it always remains on IPFS.
