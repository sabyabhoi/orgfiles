#+title: Proofs
#+filetags: :CONCEPT:CS:

The primary objective of a proof is to demonstrate that an expression of the form

\[
\forall x P(x) \to Q(x)
\]

is true. Here, we're going to examine various different methods by which such a tautology can be established.

* Direct proofs
Using the given premises, construct all the logical steps to reach the conclusion

\[
p \to q
\]

* Proof by contraposition

A crucial property of the $\to$ operator is

\[
p \to q \equiv \neg q \to \neg p
\]

We can use this property to prove the original expression. Just negate the conclusion and try to construct the logical steps that reach the negation of the original premises.

* Vacuous and trivial proofs
** Vacuous Proof
If we're given an expression of the form:

\[
p \to q
\]

And if we know that $p$ is always false, then we can directly conclude $q$. This is called a *Vacuous Proof*

** Trivial Proof
Similarly, if we know that $q$ is always true, then we can directly prove the expression. This is called a *Trivial Proof*.

* Proof by contradiction

Suppose we wish to prove that a statement $p$ is true. Furthermore, if we can conclude a contradiction $r \land \neg r$, (which is always false) from $\neg p$, or in other words:

\[
\neg p \to (r \land \neg r)
\]

Since $r \land \neg r$ is always false, $\neg p$ must also be false. Hence, $p$ must be true.

* Proof of equivalence

If a theorem is presented with a biconditional statement: /if and only if/, then we can use the following tautology to prove it:

\[
(p \iff q) \iff (p \to q) \land (q \to p)
\]
