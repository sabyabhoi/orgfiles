#+title: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
#+filetags: :CS:

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes ~p~ and ~q~ as the lowest node in ~T~ in the [[id:a5f37e57-e61c-4a10-93cd-f3c87b44b064][Binary Tree]] that has both ~p~ and ~q~ as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

#+begin_example
lca(4, 7) = 2
lca(2, 6) = 2
#+end_example

* Solution
#+begin_src c++
Node *lca(Node *head, int a, int b) {
  if (head == nullptr || head->val == a || head->val == b)
    return head;

  Node* left = lca(head->left, a, b),
	*right = lca(head->right, a, b);

  if(left == nullptr) return right;
  else if(right == nullptr) return left;

  return head;
