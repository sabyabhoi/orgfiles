#+title: Cost function
#+filetags: :CS:

- The cost function helps in assessing the accuracy of the model's predictions and guides the learning process by providing a measure to minimize during training.
- The goal is to find the set of model parameters that minimize the cost function, thereby optimizing the performance of the model. 
  
It is of the form:

\[
\textrm{cost}(X, y | w, b) = \frac{1}{2 m} \sum (\textrm{Loss}(X, y | w, b))
\]

The loss function differs in case of different algorithms.
