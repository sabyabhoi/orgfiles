#+title: Porter's 5 forces
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

- Used to assess a firm's competitive position in its respective industry.
- The five forces are given below:
* Threat from substitutes
The threat of substitute products/services arises when the consumer can /easily/ switch to the substitutes; in other words, when _the switching cost is low_.
* Threat from internal rivalry
* Threat from new entrants
_Barriers to entry_ such as 
- patents
- high fixed costs/initial capital requirements
- government regulations
- technological expertise
are crucial for determining threat from new entrants.
* Bargaining power of suppliers
- Small companies are often at the mercy of the suppliers, because they lack _wide distribution network_.
* Bargaining power of customers
