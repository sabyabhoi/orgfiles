#+title: Poisson Distribution

It is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of an event happening more than 1 times.

\begin{align*}
pdf &= \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!} e^{-\lambda} 
\end{align*}

Its mean is equal to its variance.

\begin{align*}
E(k) = \textrm{Var}(k) = \lambda
\end{align*}
