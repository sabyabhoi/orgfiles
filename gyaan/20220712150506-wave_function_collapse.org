#+title: Wave Function Collapse
#+filetags: :CS:

- Originally a concept in *Quantum Mechanics*.
- Relies heavily on the idea of _entropy_ from *Information Theory*.

* What does it mean to "collapse" a wave function?
- Consider a Sudoku. When we attempt to solve it, we pick the cells with the least entropy (possibly one option), and fill it with that option. 
- In this manner, when we're able to fill in a cell with the only valid option, we're essentially /collapsing/ the cell.
- This further reduces the entropy of its neigbouring cells. This way we can solve the entire Sudoku board.
