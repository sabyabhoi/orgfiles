#+title: Non-Linear Transformations of Regression Models
#+filetags: :ECONOMICS:

Given any [[id:4f2897a7-ceae-4fed-ac80-94ed75e79d64][Regression Model]], we can perform various transformations on the independent as well as the dependent variables to capture non-linear relationships.

* Log-Level model

\[
\log(y) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x + u
\]

Differentiating on both sides, we get

\[
100 \cdot \frac{\partial y}{y} = 100 \cdot \beta_{1}_{} \cdot \partial x
\]

This means that if we increase $x$ by 1 unit, $y$ increases by 100\beta_1%.

* Log-Log model

\[
\log (y) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \log(x) + u
\]

Differentiating on both sides, we get

\[
\beta_{1} = \frac{\partial y/y}{\partial x / x} 
\]

This is the elasticity of $y$ with respect to $x$.

*Note*: Log-Log model is also known as *constant elasticity model*.

* Level-Log model

\[
y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \log(x) + u
\]

Differentiating on both sides, we get

\[
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x / x} = \beta_{1}
\]

If $x$ increases by 1%, then $y$ increases by $\beta_{1}/100$ units.
