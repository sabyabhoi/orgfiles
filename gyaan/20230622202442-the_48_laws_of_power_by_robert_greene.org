#+title:The 48 Laws of Power
#+AUTHOR:Robert Greene
#+filetags: :BOOK:

This is one of the most chaotic book I've ever read. By chaotic, I don't necessarily mean evil. It just means that it is one of the most unfiltered books I've ever read. The ideas presented in the book are usually never discussed and are considered /immoral/ or /dirty/ in our society. But the author and many readers of the book argue that these concepts enable us to obtain a new perspective on the idea of power, and how those in authority employ various deceptive techniques to achieve it.
