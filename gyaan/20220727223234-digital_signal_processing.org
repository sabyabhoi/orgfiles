* Quantization
It is the process of taking a signal of infinitely-many continuous signal points, and mapping it to a finite, discrete set of points.
* Sampling Rate
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       decbac65-edd7-478e-8a02-64a522e3db71
:END:
- It is the rate at which the audio signal is interpreted.
- E.g. if the sampling rate is 48 kHz, then the audio signal is recorded into digital format 48,000 times per second.
- In between the intervals wherein no sampling is done, the audio signal is /held/. This is called *sample and hold*.

* Bit Depth
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e2fc9294-621c-4a0b-bed8-62f5fea35265
:END:
- Defines the accuracy of the amplitude of the interpreted signal.
- E.g. if the bit depth is 16, then the amplitude can take values in the range [-1, 1] with a step of 1/2^16.
* Nyquistâ€“Shannon Sampling theorem

:END:
- This theorem states that in order for a digital signal to capture all the necessary information of the original analog signal, its *[[id:decbac65-edd7-478e-8a02-64a522e3db71][sampling rate]] must be atleast twice the frequency of the analog signal*.
  
\[
\textrm{sampling rate} = 2\times\textrm{frequency}
\]

- E.g. if the frequency of the signal is 20 kHz, then the sampling rate should be atleast 40 kHz.
- The human ear can hear sounds with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz; therefore the standard sampling rate across a lot of digital audio programs is set be greater than 40 kHz.

* Aliasing

:END:
- When the frequency of the audio signal is higher than the [[id:decbac65-edd7-478e-8a02-64a522e3db71][Sampling Rate]], then the frequency of the quantized signal is lower than that of the original signal.
