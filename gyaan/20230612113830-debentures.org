#+title:Debentures
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

- Basically they're like bonds, but are usually issued by firms and aren't backed by any collateral or bank (more risky).
- Usually, debentures have a term of 1 to 3 years.

Two types of debentures:
* Secured
In case of liquidation of the company, the holders of the secured debentures are going to be compensated first.
* Unsecured
