- 7^th chords are triads with the 7^th node of the respective scale added to them

* Major 7^th
- *Denoted by M7, Maj7 or \Delta*
- major triad + major 7 interval.

[[id:f46759da-a6c9-4644-b851-3b39fcfd8da2][Intervals]]: *R M3 P5 M7*

* Minor 7^th
- *Denoted by m7 or -7* 
- minor triad + minor 7 interval.

[[id:f46759da-a6c9-4644-b851-3b39fcfd8da2][Intervals]]: *R m3 P5 m7*

* Dominant 7^th
- *Denoted by 7*
- major triad + minor 7 interval.

** Why dominant chords are called "Dominant".
Suppose we're constructing the C7 chord; then in order to do so, we take the scale in which C is /dominant/, that is, C is at an [[id:f46759da-a6c9-4644-b851-3b39fcfd8da2][interval of P5]].

F major = F G A Bb C D E F

We re-arrange it to start from C to get

_C_ D _E_ F _G_ A _Bb_

Hence, we get

C7 = C E G B
