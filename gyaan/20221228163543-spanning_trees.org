#+title: Spanning Trees
#+filetags: :CONCEPT:CS:

A spanning tree is a tree formed using a graph =G = (V, E)= such that it has the same vertices =V=. 

*Note*: All trees with vertices =V= have =|V| - 1= edges.

* Minimum weight spanning tree

Given a graph =G = (V, E)= with weights =W=, we're interested in finding the spanning tree with the minimum sum of weights.
Therefore, a /minimum spanning tree/ in a connected weighted graph is a spanning tree that has the smallest possible sum of weights of its edges.
