- Given a random variable $x$, we wish to bring it into reasonable ranges.
- Few of the commonly used techniques are as follows:

\[
a \le x \le b
\]  

* Divide by Maximum

\[
x = \frac{x}{b}
\]

* Mean Normalization

\[
x = \frac{x - \mu}{b - a}
\]

* z-Score Normalization

\[
x = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]
