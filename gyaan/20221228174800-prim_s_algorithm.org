It is a [[id:f5b392bd-7d43-481d-8873-1a7e25b5596d][greedy algorithm]] used to find the [[id:11bbbc86-d34c-4800-8e1e-422c902fa992][Minimum weight spanning tree]] in a [[id:5606497d-39ad-4cd6-aa86-bdb8055f0f23][graph]].

* Approach
1. Begin by choosing any edge with the smallest weight, putting it in the spanning tree.
2. Successively add to the tree, edges of minimum weight that are incident to a vertex already in the tree, never forming a simple circuit with those edges in the tree.
3. Stop when =n - 1= edges have been added.
