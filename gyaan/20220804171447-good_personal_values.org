* Traits of good personal values
- These are the [[id:b83aba99-4575-407e-a48b-48a538d73b1d][personal values]] which are
** Reality based
- Remain static from person to person (for the most part)
- E.g. if I'm honest, then there's no other way of viewing it (even from someone else's) perspective.
** Socially constructive
- Improves you and the society
** Immediate and controllable
- You have immediate and direct control over the value.
- E.g. If you wish to be honest, then you can start being honest immediately.

* Notably Important Personal values
** Being responsible for everything
- This does not insinuate being /at fault/ for everything, but being *responsible* for everything in one's life.
- It is completely your choice to (re)act the way you do; face your problems or deal with hardships.
** Embracing uncertainties in life
** Embracing Failures
** Embracing Rejections
The thought of getting rejected by a girl, and being laughed at by her friends for it might sound scary, but in 20 years, nobody is going to care.
** Contemplating one's own mortality
