#+title: DOS Function Calls
#+filetags: :CS:

In the [[id:2c8335ac-5776-4dba-9cbd-0873a7555f13][8086 Microprocessor]], we can make several function calls. Here are the important ones.

* Read the keyboard with echo
#+begin_src asm
MOV AH, 01
INT 21H
#+end_src

The ASCII value of the key pressed is stored in ~AL~ and the key is also printed out on the screen.

* Read the keyboard without echo
#+begin_src asm
MOV AH, 08
INT 21H
#+end_src

The ASCII value of the key pressed is stored in ~AL~ but the character isn't printed out on the screen.

* Print character to standard output
#+begin_src asm
MOV DL, CHAR
MOV AH, 02
INT 21H
#+end_src

* Print string to standard output
#+begin_src asm
LEA DX, STRING
MOV AH, 09
INT 21H
#+end_src
