#+title: Depth-First Search
#+filetags: :CS:

- Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore or search through a graph or tree data structure.
- DFS may not visit all nodes in a disconnected graph, so additional steps might be needed to cover all components.
- The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- DFS can be used for various applications, such as finding connected components, determining if a path exists between two nodes, and solving puzzles like maze traversal.
