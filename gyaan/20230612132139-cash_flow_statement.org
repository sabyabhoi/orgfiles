#+title:Cash Flow Statement
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

* Net Cash from operating activities
- Profit before Tax + DA
- Negative cash flow from operating activities should be avoided, because it means that the core operations of the company are not generating sufficient cash.
* Cash flow from investing activities
- A negative cash flow from investing activities shouldn't necessarily be treated as a bad sign, as it would mean that we've invested more and sold less.
* Cash flow from financing activities
- Financing means raising money or repaying money.
- Positive value: raising money
- Negative value: repaying money
* Free Cash Flow

- It is calculated as Cash flow from operations less net investment in fixed assets
- If the company has good profitability, but still has negative free cash flow for the past 3-4 years, don't invest.
