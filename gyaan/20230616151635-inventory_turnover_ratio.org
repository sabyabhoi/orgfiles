#+title:Inventory Turnover Ratio
#+filetags: :FINANCE:

- It is the number of times a firm was able to turnover, i.e., produce and sell all of its inventories in a given year.
- If the % increase in sales is less than % increase in inventories, that means that the company was not able to sell as much as it aimed to sell.
