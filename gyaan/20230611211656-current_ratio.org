\[
\textrm{Current ratio} = \frac{\textrm{Current Assets}}{\textrm{Current Liabilities}}
\]

- It measures a company's ability to pay off *short-term liabilities* with its current assets.
- Higher is better.
- AKA *Working Capital Ratio*.
- An ideal current ratio is 2:1.
- E.g. if the current ratio of a company is 2, then it has the ability repay all its current liabilities (using its current assets) twice.

* Case when the ratio is excessively high
- One should check the components of the current assets.
- E.g. if major portion is formed from the trade receivables, that may not be that great of a sign.
